A Python-based tool that checks if an email address (or list of emails) has appeared in known data breaches using the [Have I Been Pwned API](https://haveibeenpwned.com).
This project is designed for learning purposes only and demonstrates how Python can be used for automation, API interaction, and security awareness reporting.


**Features**

- Check a single email address or multiple addresses at once
- Query the Have I Been Pwned API for breach data
- Display breach details such as site name, date, and compromised data types
- Save results into JSON or CSV for later analysis
- Generate user-friendly reports for awareness purposes
- Python 3.8+
- A Have I Been Pwned API key


**Purpose**

This project was built to:
- Practice Python problem-solving with real-world cybersecurity challenges
- Learn how to interact with external APIs securely
- Explore the importance of data breach awareness and credential safety
- Showcase a blue teamâ€“oriented tool that aligns with modern security needs
- Enable deep problem solving through trial and error
- Create something practical/realistic within the cybersecurity field
